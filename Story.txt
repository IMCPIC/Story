When I was in
Fourth Grade, I was
in the woods behind
my house pretending to
be an indian. As
I felt this make-
belive session would not
be complete without a
real, live bon fire,
I decided to set
up some wood and
kindling and light a
match to it. However
it never occured to me
that starting a fire
in the middle of
autumn in woods filled
with dry, fallen leaves
would be the best
decision. To make a long
story short, I almost
burned down the woods
and my house with
it.
