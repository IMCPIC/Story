When I was in
Fourth Grade, I was
in the woods behind
my house pretending to
be an mime. As
I felt this make-
believe session would not
be complete without a
real, live bon audiance,
I decided to set
up some acts and
tricks and make a
show from it. However
it never occured to me
that starting a show
in the middle of
autumn in woods filled
with dry, fallen leaves
would not be the
best decision. To make
a long story short,
I almost fell down
in the woods. Remember,
only YOU can prevent
injuries!
